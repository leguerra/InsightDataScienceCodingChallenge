The solution requires python 2.7, plus the libraries datetime, json, numpy, sys and scipy. They all come with the regular python installation except for scipy (and maybe numpy) so it must be installed (it can be downloaded from https://www.scipy.org/). Also the file sparseMatrix.py is necessary, it is already included in the ./src folder.

Thank you very much for considering my application!
